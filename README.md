# PYTHON-ASSIGNMENTS
Print and Input Function:
In this assignment, you will explore the basics of Python programming by working with the print and input functions. You will learn how to display output to the console using the print function and how to receive input from the user using the input function. Through various exercises and examples, you will gain a solid understanding of how these functions work and their importance in interactive programming.

Operators and Decision Making:
This assignment focuses on operators and decision-making constructs in Python. You will learn about different types of operators such as arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators. Additionally, you will explore decision-making statements like if, elif, and else, which allow you to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions. Through coding exercises, you will practice using these operators and decision-making constructs effectively.

Loops and Looping Control Statements:
In this assignment, you will delve into loops and looping control statements in Python. You will learn about two types of loops: the for loop and the while loop. These loops enable you to repeat a block of code multiple times. Additionally, you will explore looping control statements like break, continue, and pass, which allow you to modify the behavior of loops. Through hands-on exercises, you will gain proficiency in using loops and looping control statements to create efficient and flexible programs.

String, List, and Tuple:
This assignment focuses on working with string, list, and tuple data types in Python. You will learn various operations and methods that can be applied to manipulate and analyze these data structures. You will explore string manipulation, list operations (such as appending, slicing, and sorting), and tuple properties (such as immutability and packing/unpacking). By solving practical problems and writing code snippets, you will become adept at working with strings, lists, and tuples effectively.

Data Structures:
In this assignment, you will delve into advanced data structures in Python. You will explore concepts such as sets, dictionaries, and nested data structures. Sets provide a way to store unique elements, dictionaries allow you to map keys to values, and nested data structures provide a way to store complex data hierarchies. Through coding exercises and practical examples, you will learn how to leverage these data structures to solve real-world problems efficiently.

Functions:
This assignment revolves around functions in Python. You will learn how to define and use functions to modularize your code and make it more organized and reusable. You will explore various aspects of functions, such as parameters, return values, variable scopes, and function documentation. By completing coding exercises and designing your own functions, you will develop a solid understanding of functions and their significance in building robust and maintainable programs.

File Handling and Error Exception:
In this assignment, you will focus on file handling and error exception handling in Python. You will learn how to read from and write to files, as well as how to handle different types of errors that may occur during program execution. You will explore concepts such as file modes, context managers, handling exceptions using try-except blocks, and raising custom exceptions. Through practical exercises, you will gain proficiency in working with files and effectively handling errors to create reliable and fault-tolerant programs.

Stack Overflow:
In this assignment, you will explore the concept of stack overflow and learn how to prevent and handle it in Python. Stack overflow occurs when the call stack, which keeps track of function calls and local variables, exceeds its maximum capacity. You will understand the causes and consequences of stack overflow and discover techniques to avoid it, such as tail recursion and iterative solutions. By analyzing and debugging code snippets prone to stack overflow, you will develop strategies to tackle this issue effectively.
